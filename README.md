# Middle School Projects

These files were directly downloaded from the `C:` drive of my middle school account. Other than the README, they were all made there. 

These files have won me 2 computer fairs. 

NOT all of these files are actually mine! My school actually used to use Mavis Beacon, which meant a drive specifically meant for save files and other stuff. People (including me) would post their games on this drive where the save files were meant to be, and we would get the games and download them to our own discs. This actually directly caused the school to change to Typesy, which was more secure.
