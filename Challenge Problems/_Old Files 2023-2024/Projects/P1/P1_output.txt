Story:

Today, me and Bob had a vacation. We took the plane to school.
It was the most brown vacation ever! First, the hotels were black. Also, there were
no small places to go. I wanted to go to home but it was 'too mainstream'. The other person
ate all the time there. I never want to read again because of that place. Please write me.
