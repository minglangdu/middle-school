Welcome to the Dadman Game!

This game is similar to hangman but without all the
gratuitous hanging. Instead, you are in an even scarier
situation. You did Something Very Bad and have been sent
to your room. Your dad is slowly making his way up the
stairs to give you a Talk. You are trying to come up with
a good explanation for why you did the thing you did
before your dad makes it to the top of the stairs.

Because this is a game, the only way to come up with such
an excuse is to first solve a word puzzle, and quickly.
Solve away...

The silence in your room is broken by the thunderous     pound of a boot, a sound that threatens to overwhelm your     very consciousness. Knowing you only have some time to appeal     to this dread entity, you yell out letters into the void.
